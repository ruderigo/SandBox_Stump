THE PROVISIONER — Tier 3 Technician Deployment Utility
=========================================================

A self-contained flasher / config wizard / diagnostic suite for field
technicians deploying Stump (Tier 1) and Firefly (Tier 2) hardware.

Boards it knows how to handle:
  - Heltec V3 (ESP32-S3 + SX1262), Control Plane role -> flashed as an
                                       RNode radio bridged to a CAM, via `rnodeconf`
  - Heltec V3 (ESP32-S3 + SX1262), Standalone Transport role -> flashed with
                                       microReticulum_Firmware (a self-contained
                                       Reticulum node, no CAM, no host), also via
                                       `rnodeconf`, then locked into TNC mode
  - Freenove ESP32-S3-CAM          -> flashed with MicroPython, then loaded
                                       with the Stump substance-engine app
                                       (billboard / RRC chat / BarKeep bot)

Usage:
    python3 provisioner.py                 # interactive wizard (default)
    python3 provisioner.py --scan          # just list connected boards
    python3 provisioner.py --diag PORT     # run diagnostics against a port
    python3 provisioner.py --wipe-sd PORT  # erase + reformat the CAM's SD card
    python3 provisioner.py --upload-app PORT  # re-push app files without reflashing
    python3 provisioner.py --get-ip PORT   # look up the Stump's live AP IP
    python3 provisioner.py --check-tools   # verify esptool/mpremote/rnodeconf present

Nothing here talks to a real board unless you run it on a machine that has
one plugged in. Every external call is wrapped so a missing tool or absent
board produces an explicit, readable message instead of a stack trace.

    """
    Flashes the standalone Heltec V3 transport role using
    microReticulum_Firmware -- a real, actively maintained fork of
    RNode_Firmware with the microReticulum C++ Reticulum stack built in,
    confirmed to actually work on this hardware in the field. This
    REPLACES an earlier, custom MicroPython-based approach for this
    role (identity + urns + a hand-written LoRa interface) that hit a
    real, reproducible MemoryError on actual (PSRAM-less) hardware,
    traced to native crypto module loading, and never got past it --
    while this pre-built firmware, designed from the start around
    exactly this board's memory constraints, worked immediately.

    Three steps, run in this order for a reason:

    1. --clear-cache: rnodeconf caches firmware downloads locally: if a
       previous attempt (this role's old flow, or an earlier partial
       run) already cached a build, autoinstall would silently reuse
       stale bytes instead of fetching the current release.

    2. --autoinstall --fw-url <url>: interactive (asks rnodeconf's own
       hardware questions), so this uses run_interactive like the
       existing flash_heltec_rnode() above, not the output-capturing
       run() helper.

    3. -T --freq/--bw/--txp/--sf/--cr set TOGETHER in ONE command, not
       as separate steps -- confirmed this matters: setting the
       operating mode and radio parameters separately risks rnodeconf
       dropping the write cycle or reverting to Normal (host-
       controlled) mode instead of TNC. This step deliberately treats
       what LOOKS LIKE a failure as success: switching to -T makes the
       board write to EEPROM and immediately reboot standalone, which
       drops the serial connection and surfaces as a timeout/non-zero
       exit from rnodeconf's own perspective. That's confirmed expected
       behavior for this exact transition, not a fault -- so this
       treats it as fine even when the run() call itself looks failed,
       and includes a real wait (mirroring how esptool's own hard
       reset needed a similar wait elsewhere in this file) before
       trying to talk to the board again.

    Ends with rnodeconf --info to actually confirm Device mode reads
    TNC -- not just assumed from the lock command appearing to run,
    since that command's own success/failure signal is unreliable here
    by design (see above).
