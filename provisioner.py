THE PROVISIONER — Tier 3 Technician Deployment Utility
=========================================================

A self-contained flasher / config wizard / diagnostic suite for field
technicians deploying Stump (Tier 1) and Firefly (Tier 2) hardware.

Boards it knows how to handle:
  - Heltec V3 (ESP32-S3 + SX1262)  -> flashed as an RNode radio via `rnodeconf`
  - Freenove ESP32-S3-CAM          -> flashed with MicroPython, then loaded
                                       with the Stump substance-engine app
                                       (billboard / RRC chat / BarKeep bot)

Usage:
    python3 provisioner.py                 # interactive wizard (default)
    python3 provisioner.py --scan          # just list connected boards
    python3 provisioner.py --diag PORT     # run diagnostics against a port
    python3 provisioner.py --wipe-sd PORT  # erase + reformat the CAM's SD card
    python3 provisioner.py --upload-app PORT  # re-push app files without reflashing
    python3 provisioner.py --get-ip PORT   # look up the Stump's live AP IP
    python3 provisioner.py --check-tools   # verify esptool/mpremote/rnodeconf present

Nothing here talks to a real board unless you run it on a machine that has
one plugged in. Every external call is wrapped so a missing tool or absent
board produces an explicit, readable message instead of a stack trace.
