NODE_NAME = 'LaBuche'

# The walk-up hotspot's own name -- separate from NODE_NAME (the mesh
# identity's display name) on purpose; these are different concerns.
# None means "use the default hosted page" (captive_portal.DEFAULT_SSID,
# currently "LaBuche-Stump.web.app") -- a real, publicly hosted page
# that explains what this network is, so someone can read the name off
# their phone's WiFi list and type it straight into a browser on their
# own data, before ever joining. Set to a string to use a custom name
# instead.
SSID_NAME = None

# Whether the AP's own IP address is appended to the broadcast WiFi
# name. Only meaningful with a CUSTOM SSID_NAME -- the default hosted-
# page domain (21 characters) plus an IP suffix is 33 characters, one
# over WiFi's hard 32-byte SSID limit, and truncating a real web
# address by even one character breaks it as something a browser can
# resolve. Defaults to False specifically because SSID_NAME defaults
# to None (the hosted page) -- the two defaults have to be consistent
# with each other out of the box, not just after the Provisioner wizard
# runs (which enforces this by construction: the IP question is only
# ever asked in the custom-name branch). Confirmed directly: the raw
# template previously shipped with this at True, which is broken
# paired with the default SSID_NAME -- caught it from a headless boot
# of the unprovisioned template producing a truncated, non-resolving
# URL ("LaBuche-Stump.web." instead of "LaBuche-Stump.web.app").
SSID_INCLUDE_IP = False

# The name the local greeter answers to on the web pages. Purely
# cosmetic and per-node -- it has nothing to do with NODE_NAME above,
# which is the identity mesh peers see.
BOT_NAME = 'Concierge'

# Sent once to each mesh peer the first time they message this node.
# Blank disables it entirely.
#
# Once per peer, not once per message, on purpose: every LXMF send costs
# real airtime and roughly seven seconds of crypto on the S3, so an
# auto-reply on every inbound message would answer a three-word question
# with a paragraph and do it again for the next three words. A greeting
# on first contact says who this node is and what it offers; after that
# the conversation is the point.
MESH_GREETING = "Bonjour Hi! Je suis Concierge et je tiens cette Buche! Plus  d'info: Labuche-Stump.web.app"
MESH_GREETING_MAX = 200

# How often this node announces its LXMF identity to the mesh, in
# seconds. Every announce is a fully synchronous crypto operation that
# freezes the whole event loop for however long signing takes -- a
# shorter interval means more frequent freezes (and, per a real field
# report, a better chance of tripping the Heltec bridge's own
# disconnect tolerance and forcing a full radio reconfigure). A longer
# interval means slower route discovery for anyone new to the mesh.
# 120s is the value this project shipped with before this setting
# existed; not connected to CONFIG["probe"]'s own announce_interval
# below, which governs a separate, disabled-by-default diagnostic
# destination, not this node's main identity.
REANNOUNCE_INTERVAL = 120

# Announce rebroadcast throttling. When this node relays for the mesh,
# it won't rebroadcast more than ANNOUNCE_RATE_MAX announces from the
# same source within ANNOUNCE_RATE_WINDOW seconds -- protects the wider
# mesh from any one chatty node's announces being relayed excessively.
# These match urns/const.py's own built-in defaults; only set them here
# if a deployment specifically needs to tune the throttle.
