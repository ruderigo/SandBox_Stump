# µReticulum WiFi Serial Interface -- REAL KISS PROTOCOL, fixed 2026-07-25
# Place at: firmware/urns/interfaces/wifi_serial.py
#
# TCP connection to a WiFi Remote-enabled RNode (an RNode switched to
# `-w STATION` mode via rnodeconf, reachable on the LAN instead of over
# USB), speaking REAL RNode KISS protocol.
#
# CORRECTED 2026-07-25, after live LED/reception testing proved the
# original version silently failed to transmit anything a real RNode
# would recognize -- confirmed by direct comparison: the Mac's known-good
# reference-RNS connection lit the Heltec's LED and was seen by a second
# Heltec running RNode; this file's own announce, at the exact moment it
# claimed to transmit, produced no LED activity and no reception at all.
#
# Confirmed by reading reference RNS's actual RNodeInterface.py source
# directly -- not by general KISS-protocol assumption, which is exactly
# what produced the original bug:
#
#   1. WRONG ESCAPE SCHEME. serial.py/tcp.py/the original version of this
#      file all use an XOR-mask scheme (FLAG=0x7E, ESC=0x7D, ESC_MASK=0x20)
#      internal to micropython-reticulum. Real RNode hardware speaks
#      classic KISS: FEND=0xC0, FESC=0xDB, with byte SUBSTITUTION escaping
#      (FESC->FESC+TFESC, FEND->FESC+TFEND), not XOR. Different protocols.
#      A real RNode does not parse the old scheme as valid data.
#
#   2. MISSING RADIO CONFIGURATION. RNode ships in host-controlled mode --
#      the radio sits in standby until told what frequency/bandwidth/
#      power/SF/CR to use. Reference RNS sends six commands on every
#      connect (initRadio()). The original version of this file never
#      sent any of them.
#
#   3. MISSING CMD_DATA COMMAND BYTE. Every KISS frame needs a command
#      byte immediately after the opening FEND. Real data frames are
#      FEND + CMD_DATA(0x00) + escaped_payload + FEND -- the original
#      version sent FEND + escaped_payload + FEND with no command byte.
#
# CONFIDENCE NOTE: process_outgoing() below is a direct, confirmed match
# to reference RNS's real source, byte for byte. _process_byte() (the
# receive side) is a careful RECONSTRUCTION from the confirmed escape
# scheme, the confirmed frame structure, and one confirmed line of the
# real read loop (closing on FEND when command == CMD_DATA) -- the real
# readLoop() runs long and wasn't pulled in its entirety. If receiving
# looks wrong after this fix, pulling the rest of that function is the
# next real step, not a symptom to guess around.
#
# VALIDATION UPDATE (Claude, 2026-08-14): both process_outgoing() and the
# constants below were independently cross-checked against the actual
# upstream RNS.Interfaces.RNodeInterface.py source (from the real
# markqvist/Reticulum repo, not a web summary of it) -- every constant,
# the escape() function, and process_outgoing()'s frame construction are
# byte-for-byte identical to the real implementation. This is now
# confirmed two ways: your own hardware LED/signature tests, and direct
# source comparison against the authoritative reference.
#
# Radio defaults below match what's been carried since Fold 1, now
# including TX power -- missing from earlier config work here, caught via
# MeshCommander's own real, working R36S setup: 915000000 Hz / 125000 Hz /
# SF8 / CR5 / 7dBm.
#
# Socket handling (connect, reconnect, the non-blocking dance around the
# ESP32-S3 lwIP sendall() bug) is UNCHANGED from the previous version --
# that layer was separately confirmed correct (both the Mac's connection
# and this file's own held clean TCP sessions). Only the protocol riding
# on top of it was wrong.
