# Project Stump -- fservbot core (dialogue engine + settings + admin)
# Place at: final_firmware/fservbot/core.py
#
# The dialogue table and everything that edits it. Pure logic: binds
# nothing, starts no task, and is called only from install.py's wrapper
# around rrc.handle_input. Same shape as billboard.py and fserv.py --
# storage, state, and text, with the HTTP layer somewhere else.
#
# TWO SETUP SURFACES, ONE BACKEND. A technician can preset everything
# through the provisioner (which writes config.py), and a user in the
# RRC channel who knows the operator password can change the same
# things live with /fs* commands. Both read and write the state below,
# so neither can produce a node the other can't understand.
#
# WHAT IS CONFIG AND WHAT IS CONTENT. The password itself is only
# settable from config.py -- i.e. by a technician with the provisioner
# or a serial connection. It is deliberately NOT changeable from chat:
# a password that can be rotated by whoever currently holds it is a
# door that locks the operator out of their own node, and the README's
# "Air-gapped administration" section is explicit that settings belong
# behind a physical connection. Dialogues, the trigger prefix, and the
# broadcast interval are content-level, so they are editable from the
# channel, and persist to SD alongside the billboard.
