# Project Stump -- stumpid (identity verification plugin)
# Place at: firmware/stumpid/core.py
#
# Answers one question rrc.py deliberately doesn't: is the client behind
# this connection provably the same client as last time?
#
# rrc.py's client_id is the peer IP (or, for mesh peers via rrc_mesh, the
# LXMF destination hash). Both are honest about what they are: identifiers
# of a CONNECTION, not of a PERSON. An IP is reassigned by DHCP and shared
# across reconnects; nothing stops two different people from presenting
# the same one to two different rooms. That's fine for ordinary chat, and
# rrc.py says so plainly -- "fine for per-device chat state, not a
# security boundary."
#
# stumpid adds a second, optional layer on top: a real Ed25519 identity
# (RNS's Identity class, the same one this node already uses for its own
# LXMF address) that a client can PROVE it holds, via a signed nonce. That
# proof is what makes an identity portable across reconnects, across
# transports (WiFi today, LoRa via rrc_mesh), and eventually across
# Stumps -- the identity_hash survives a changed IP or a new LoRa session
# in a way client_id never could.
