# Project Stump -- stumpid activation
# Place at: firmware/stumpid/install.py
#
# Wraps rrc.handle_input exactly the way fservbot does: capture whatever
# is CURRENTLY bound to it, replace it, delegate to the captured value
# for anything this plugin doesn't own itself. Two plugins doing this
# compose correctly regardless of which activates first -- each only
# ever sees "the handler as it stood a moment ago", never a hardcoded
# assumption about what that is.
#
# ORDERING NOTE, stated plainly because it matters here in a way it
# didn't for fservbot: stumpid needs to be the OUTERMOST wrapper, since
# gating a write means intercepting it before anything else acts on it.
# load_plugins() activates folders in alphabetical order, and
# "stumpid" > "fservbot", so stumpid activates second and wraps outer.
# That is correct today by virtue of the name, not by any enforced
# priority -- worth knowing if a plugin sorting alphabetically ahead of
# "stumpid" is ever added and also wants to gate writes.
